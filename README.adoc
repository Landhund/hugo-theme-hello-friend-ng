= Hello Friend NG for https://www.mad-cad-it.com/[Mad CAD IT]
:toc: preamble


This theme started out as a Fork of https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng[rhazdon's Hello Friend NG] Hugo theme.
A big Thank You! to him for his excellent work!

I've then forked it to modify it to fit my needs.
While it _should_ work with most Hugo setups, it's not really intended to be used as-is by other blogs, mostly because I continuously tinker with it and make various changes.
So if you like it, clone it into your own fork and enjoy!

[,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/Landhund/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git themes/hello-friend-ng-mad-cad-it

== Disclaimer

The rest of this Readme is essentially just rhazdon's readme.
Most of it should still hold true, but at some point I'll have to really document the features I've changed and added.

== How to start

You can download the theme manually by going to https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git and pasting it to `themes/hello-friend-ng` in your root directory.

You can also clone it directly to your Hugo folder:


If you don't want to make any radical changes, it's the best option, because you can get new updates when they are available.
To do so, include it as a git submodule:

[,bash]
----
$ git submodule add https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git themes/hello-friend-ng
----

== How to configure

The theme doesn't require any advanced configuration.
Just copy the following config file.
To see all possible configurations, xref:docs/config.adoc[check the docs].
Note: There are more options to configure.
Take a look into the `config.toml` in `exampleSite`.

[,toml]

baseurl      = "localhost"

  dateformNumTime = "2006-01-02 15:04"

  # Subtitle for home

== More things

=== Built-in shortcodes

Of course you are able to use all default shortcodes from hugo (https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/).

==== image

Properties:

* `src` (required)
* `alt` (optional)
* `position` (optional, default: `left`, options: [`left`, `center`, `right`])
* `style`

Example:

[,golang]
----
{{< image src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}
----

=== Code highlighting

By default the theme is using PrismJS to color your code syntax.
All you need to do is to wrap you code like this:

....

``` html
  // your code here
```
....

=== Favicon

Check the xref:docs/favicons.adoc[docs].

=== Audio Support

You wrote an article and recorded it?
Or do you have a special music that you would like to put on a certain article?
Then you can do this now without further ado.

In your article add to your front matters part:

[,yaml]
----
audio: path/to/file.mp3
----

== Social Icons:

A large variety of social icons are available and can be configured like this:

[,toml]
----
[[params.social]]
  name = "<site>"
  url = "<profile_URL>"
----

Take a look into this xref:docs/svgs.adoc[list] of available icon options.

If you need another one, just open an issue or create a pull request with your wished icon.
:)

== Known issues

There is a bug in Hugo that sometimes causes the main page not to render correctly.
The reason is an empty taxonomy part.
Related issue tickets: https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/issues/14[!14] https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/issues/59[!59].

Either you comment it out completely or you write the following in

[,toml]
----
[taxonomies]
  tag      = "tags"
  category = "categories"
----

== How to edit the theme

Just edit it.
You don't need any node stuff.
